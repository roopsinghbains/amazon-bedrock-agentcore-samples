# Understanding Runtime Context and Session Management in AgentCore Runtime

## Overview

In this tutorial, we will learn how to understand and work with runtime context and session management in Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Runtime. This example demonstrates how AgentCore Runtime handles sessions, maintains context across multiple invocations, and how agents can access runtime information through the context object.

Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Runtime provides isolated sessions for each user interaction, enabling agents to maintain context and state across multiple invocations while ensuring complete security isolation between different users.

### Tutorial Architecture

In this tutorial, we will explore how Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Runtime manages sessions and provides context to agents. We'll demonstrate:

1. **Session Continuity**: How the same session ID maintains context across multiple invocations
2. **Context Object**: How agents can access runtime information through the context parameter
3. **Session Isolation**: How different session IDs create completely isolated environments
4. **Payload Flexibility**: How to pass custom data to agents through the payload

For demonstration purposes, we will use a Strands Agent that showcases these session management capabilities.
