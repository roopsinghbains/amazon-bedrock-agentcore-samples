# Streaming Responses with Strands Agents and Amazon Bedrock models in Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Runtime

## Overview

In this tutorial we will learn how to implement streaming responses using Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Runtime with your existing agents. 

We will focus on a Strands Agents with Amazon Bedrock model example that demonstrates real-time streaming capabilities.

### Tutorial Architecture

In this tutorial we will describe how to deploy a streaming agent to AgentCore runtime. 

For demonstration purposes, we will use a Strands Agent using Amazon Bedrock models with streaming capabilities.

In our example we will use a simple agent with three tools: `get_weather`, `get_time`, and `calculator`, but enhanced with real-time streaming response capabilities.
