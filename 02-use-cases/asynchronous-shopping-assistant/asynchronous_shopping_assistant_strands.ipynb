    "### Use Case Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "This shopping assistant demonstrates a powerful pattern for building responsive AI agents that can handle time-consuming tasks without blocking the conversation flow:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The user asks about products they're interested in\n",
    "2. The agent launches a background task using AgentCore's async capabilities\n",
    "3. While the background task runs, the agent can continue conversing with the user\n",
    "4. When results are ready, they're stored in a file that the agent can access\n",
    "5. The agent can retrieve and present the results when appropriate\n",
    "\n",
    "The architecture combines several key components:\n",
    "- **Strands**: For building the agent's workflow and multi-agent orchestration\n",
    "- **AgentCore Runtime**: For hosting and scaling the agent\n",
    "- **AgentCore Async Tasks**: For managing background operations\n",
    "- **Browser Tool**: For searching and extracting product information\n",
    "- **File System**: For storing and retrieving search results\n",
    "\n",
    "![](images/architecture_diagram.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Agent Flow Diagram\n",
    "\n",
    "The following diagram illustrates the flow of our multi-agent system using Strands:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](images/async_shopping_main.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Agent Workflow Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **User Request**: The user makes a shopping-related query (e.g., \"What's the price of Echo Dot?\")\n",
    "2. **Fronting Agent**: Evaluates the request and determines if it requires product search\n",
    "3. **Conditional Routing**: If shopping is needed, the request is routed to the Shopping Agent\n",
    "4. **Background Task**: The Shopping Agent launches a background browser task using NovaAct\n",
    "5. **Parallel Conversation**: While the search runs, the Fronting Agent continues conversing with the user\n",
    "6. **Result Storage**: When the browser task completes, results are saved to a file\n",
    "7. **Task Completion**: The background task is marked as complete in AgentCore\n",
    "8. **Result Retrieval**: When the user asks for results, the Reporting Agent reads the file and presents findings\n",
    "9. **Multi-Search Support**: For product comparisons, multiple browser sessions can run in parallel\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Features\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Asynchronous Task Management**: Launch background tasks that don't block the conversation\n",
    "* **Browser Tool Integration**: Use AgentCore's Browser Tool to search and extract product information\n",
    "* **Multi-Agent Orchestration**: Coordinate between fronting, shopping, and reporting agents using Strands\n",
    "* **File System Integration**: Store and retrieve search results using file system tools\n",
    "* **Parallel Processing**: Handle multiple product searches simultaneously\n"

    "## Understanding Asynchronous Agents\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional conversational agents process user requests synchronously, which means they block the conversation until a task is complete. This approach works well for quick operations but creates a poor user experience for time-consuming tasks like web browsing or complex searches.\n",
    "\n",
    "Asynchronous agents solve this problem by:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Non-blocking operations**: Tasks run in the background while the conversation continues\n",
    "2. **Task management**: The agent can start, monitor, and retrieve results from background tasks\n",
    "3. **Improved responsiveness**: Users get immediate feedback and can continue interacting\n",
    "\n",
    "Amazon Bedrock AgentCore provides built-in support for asynchronous operations through its task management capabilities, which we'll leverage in this shopping assistant.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Shopping Assistant Use Case\n",
    "\n",
    "Our shopping assistant will:\n",
    "- Accept product search queries from users\n",
    "- Launch background tasks to search Amazon.com using the Browser Tool\n",
    "- Continue conversing with the user while searches run\n",
    "- Store search results in files when complete\n",
    "- Retrieve and present results when the user asks for them\n",
    "\n",
    "This pattern is particularly valuable for e-commerce applications where product searches can take time, but users expect responsive interactions."

    "\n",
    "The `async_shopping_with_strands.py` file contains the complete implementation of our asynchronous shopping assistant. Let's explore its key components:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **AgentCore Integration**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   from bedrock_agentcore.runtime import BedrockAgentCoreApp\n",
    "   app = BedrockAgentCoreApp()\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   This initializes the AgentCore application that will host our agent.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Browser Tool Implementation**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   @tool(name=\"background_shopping\", description=\"Based on the incoming shopping request, this agent-as-a-tool starts a background shopping task and writes a result file when done.\")\n",
    "   def call_browser_tool(request: str):\n",

    "   ```\n",
    "   This function runs a browser task in the background using NovaAct and AgentCore's async task management.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Multi-Agent Architecture**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   fronting_agent = Agent(name=\"fronting_assistant\", \n",
    "                       system_prompt=\"...\",\n",
    "                       tools=[get_tasks_info, file_read],\n",

    "                       model=haiku)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   This creates three specialized agents with different responsibilities in the workflow.\n",

    "4. **Strands Graph Builder**:\n",

    "   builder = GraphBuilder()\n",

    "   \n",
    "   graph = builder.build()\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   This creates a Strands graph with conditional routing between agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Entrypoint Function**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   @app.entrypoint\n",
    "   def handler(payload, context):\n",
    "       if \"test\" in payload:\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we've built an asynchronous shopping assistant using Strands and Amazon Bedrock AgentCore. Our agent can:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Accept product search queries from users\n",
    "2. Launch background tasks to search for products\n",
    "3. Continue conversing with the user while searches run\n",
    "4. Store search results in files when complete\n",
    "5. Retrieve and present results when the user asks for them\n",
    "\n",
    "This pattern is particularly valuable for applications where tasks can take time to complete, but users expect responsive interactions. By leveraging AgentCore's asynchronous capabilities and Strands' multi-agent orchestration, we can create agents that provide a much better user experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Asynchronous agents** provide a better user experience for time-consuming tasks\n",
    "- **AgentCore Runtime** makes it easy to deploy and scale agents\n",
    "- **Browser Tool** enables agents to search and extract information from websites\n",
    "- **Strands** provides a flexible framework for building multi-agent systems\n",
    "- **File System Integration** allows agents to store and retrieve results\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "To further enhance this shopping assistant, you could:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Add product comparison capabilities\n",
    "2. Implement user preferences and personalization\n",
    "3. Add support for multiple search providers\n",
    "4. Integrate with e-commerce APIs for real-time pricing and availability\n",
    "5. Implement memory to remember user preferences across sessions"
