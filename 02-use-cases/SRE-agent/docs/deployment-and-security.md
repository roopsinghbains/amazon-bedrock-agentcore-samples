# Deployment and Security

This is a sample implementation that provides examples from a demo environment with simulated data. The agent is deployed in a self-managed way for demonstration purposes.

## Deployment Options

**Demo Implementation**: This sample shows a self-managed deployment running on virtual machines with Python 3.12+ runtime environment. The implementation uses simulated data and mock APIs to demonstrate the multi-agent architecture and capabilities.

**Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Runtime**: For production scenarios, Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Runtime provides a serverless, auto-scaling environment that eliminates infrastructure management overhead and provides built-in security, monitoring, and cost optimization.

## Security Considerations

When working with infrastructure data, consider these general security practices:

- Implement API authentication using OAuth2 or API keys for infrastructure endpoints
- Use AWS IAM roles for Bedrock access instead of long-lived credentials
- Enable TLS encryption for API communications
- Implement audit logging for agent actions and investigations
- Use secret management systems for credential storage
- Apply principle of least privilege for API access
- Regularly rotate API keys and tokens
- Monitor for unusual access patterns or suspicious activities
